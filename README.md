# file sorter

A simple script that moves files into folder given the year & month.

## Assumptions

You have a folder with an insane amount of files
You want to sort files per year & month in the same folder.

Files follow one of the following naming formats: `IMG_YYYYMMDD_*+` or `YYYYMMDD_*+`

You are ok ignoring folders
